Over four years of experience in developing and maintaining mission-critical backend. I've worked in a small startup where I've created tools to monitor and analyze user behavior, and built an internal portal for our support team to assist customers. I'm passionate about creating software that solves complex problems through elegant solutions.


## **Experience**

**2019 - Present, Software Engineer, TrainPain LTD**

As the only Software Engineer in a  fast paced startup, I had a broad range of responsibility, including:

- Building and Maintaining a Full Stack content and users management and monitoring dashboard using **React Js** with **React Testing Library**, and utilizing Azure Static Web Apps, **Node Js** and **Azure Functions** for the **RESTful API**

- Building and Maintaining the backend of the main Unity mobile game using Azure Playfab SAS

- Building various tools to help the team with different tasks

- Building CI/CD workflows in Github Actions

- Developing the hardware firmware (built in BGScript language)

- Building testing tools to test the hardware components and the firmware (in C)

- QA and manual testing the products

- Release management and coordination between developers and QA team

- R&D and calibrate different app features and hardware


### **Key Achievement**

The main app was a Unity game, and designing a level required a lot of manual and tedious work. So, I've created a custom tool using **HTML/CSS/Javascript/ejs** with a **Node js** backend and hosted on **Azure**, that allowed the levels designers to easily "draw" the levels, conduct web-based testing, and send the designed levels to their phones in seconds. Which resulted in a huge increase in productivity and enabled the level designers to iterate and design  higher-quality levels.
